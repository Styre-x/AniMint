An animated wallpaper manager for Linux Mint 22. Likely works on other Ubuntu-based distributions, please check and let me know!
Currently very bare-bones, more will be added soon.

It is very simple to use:

Install required libraries:
sudo apt-get install python3-gi
pip install PyQt5 python-xlib

Run the main file with the path to the video you'd like to set as your desktop background:
python3 main.py /path/to/video.mp4

To be added:
An easy way to switch and add wallpapers through a GUI.
A better right-click menu with customization options
